Sequence Diagram

You can also refer to various step by step implementation walkthrough here.



1. Acquiring Transaction Token on Backend

API request should be done from merchant backend to acquire Snap transaction token by providing payment information and Server Key. There are at least three components that are required to obtain the Snap token which are explained in the table given below.

Element

Description

Server Key

API server key. For more details, refer to Retrieving API Access Keys

order_id

Unique transaction order ID, defined from your side. One ID could be used only once for the order of the material. Allowed character are Alphanumeric, dash(-), underscore(_), tilde (~), and dot (.) String, max 50.

gross_amount

Total amount of transaction, defined from your side. Integer.

When creating 1st transaction, the gross_amount is still required.
Although, then the actual accepted payment amount is allowed to be different that the initial gross_amount, so customer can flexibly pay with any acceptable amount.


Charge API Sample Request

Endpoints
Environment	Method	URL
Sandbox	POST	https://app.sandbox.midtrans.com/snap/v1/transactions
Production	POST	https://app.midtrans.com/snap/v1/transactions

HTTP Headers

Accept	application/json
Content-Type	application/json
Authorization	Basic AUTH_STRING

AUTH_STRING: Base64Encode("YourServerKey"+":")


📘
Midtrans API validates HTTP request by using Basic Authentication method. The username is your Server Key while the password is empty. The authorization header value is represented by AUTH_STRING. AUTH_STRING is base-64 encoded string of your username and password separated by colon symbol (:). For more details, refer to API Authorization and Headers.


Sample Request to Obtain Transaction Token

cURL
PHP
NodeJS
Java
Python
Go

/*Install Midtrans PHP Library (https://github.com/Midtrans/midtrans-php)
composer require midtrans/midtrans-php
                              
Alternatively, if you are not using **Composer**, you can download midtrans-php library 
(https://github.com/Midtrans/midtrans-php/archive/master.zip), and then require 
the file manually.   

require_once dirname(__FILE__) . '/pathofproject/Midtrans.php'; */

//SAMPLE REQUEST START HERE

// Set your Merchant Server Key
\Midtrans\Config::$serverKey = 'YOUR_SERVER_KEY';
// Set to Development/Sandbox Environment (default). Set to true for Production Environment (accept real transaction).
\Midtrans\Config::$isProduction = false;
// Set sanitization on (default)
\Midtrans\Config::$isSanitized = true;
// Set 3DS transaction for credit card to true
\Midtrans\Config::$is3ds = true;

$params = array(
    'transaction_details' => array(
        'order_id' => rand(),
        'gross_amount' => 10000,
    ),
    'customer_details' => array(
        'first_name' => 'budi',
        'last_name' => 'pratama',
        'email' => 'budi.pra@example.com',
        'phone' => '08111222333',
    ),
);

$snapToken = \Midtrans\Snap::getSnapToken($params);
Using Postman

Please check Midtrans available language libraries for other language samples.


📘
Tips
You can include more information such as customer_details, item_details, and so on. It is recommended to send more details regarding the transaction, so that these details will be captured on the transaction record. Which can be viewed on the Midtrans Dashboard.


Learn more on why this API request should be securely managed from your backend.


Successful Sample Response

JSON

{
  "token":"66e4fa55-fdac-4ef9-91b5-733b97d1b862",
  "redirect_url":"https://app.sandbox.midtrans.com/snap/v2/vtweb/66e4fa55-fdac-4ef9-91b5-733b97d1b862"
}

Status Codes and Errors

Status Code	Description	Example
201	Successful creation of Snap token.	"token":"66e4fa55-fdac-4ef9-91b5-733b97d1b862"
401	Failed to create a token, as wrong authorization is sent.	"Access denied, please check client or server key"
4xx	Failed to create a token, as wrong parameter is sent. Follow the error_message and check your parameter.	"transaction_details.gross_amount is not equal to the sum of item_details"
5xx	Failed to create a token, because of Midtrans internal error. Most of the time this is temporary, you can retry later.	"Sorry, we encountered internal server error. We will fix this soon."


2. Displaying Snap Payment Page on Frontend

To display Snap payment page within your site, there are two methods to choose.


Redirection Method

You can use redirect_url retrieved from backend in the previous step to redirect customer to url hosted by Midtrans. Useful if you do not want (or unable) to implement via snap.js. Learn more in this alternative section.

You can also use WebView to display Snap payment page within your mobile app - also useful if you're looking to implement in cross platform applications (e.g Flutter or React) or native applications (SDK method is also available and recommended for native app - see guide here).


Javascript Method

📘
Tips
If you are using frontend framework such as ReactJS and struggling to include the script tag, please refer to this recommendation.
To ensure that Snap modal is displayed correctly on a mobile device, please include the viewport meta tag inside your <head> tag. The most common implementation is as follows :
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
Optionally, you can also use JavaScript callbacks to handle payment events triggered from customer finishing interaction with Snap payment page on frontend.

Include snap.js library into your payment page HTML. The table given below describes the components which are required to display Snap payment page.


Element	Description
Client Key	The Client Key. For more details refer to Retrieving API Access Keys
snap.js url	https://app.sandbox.midtrans.com/snap/snap.js
transaction token	Retrieved from backend in previous step

Enter your Client Key as the value of data-client-key attribute in snap.js script tag.


There are two ways to display Snap's UI modal in your web/app, first is by embedding Snap modal within your web/app's page (Embedded mode) or by displaying the modal as an overlay on your web/app's page (Pop up mode). Refer to sample implementations of Embedded mode and Pop up mode.


Embedded Mode

You can embed Snap modal within your page using this method. See how it will look like below, or try the demo here. Check also our integration recipe for step by step implementation walkthrough.

Embed Snap Modal

Steps to implement :

Create an empty div with the desired ID, e.g. <div id="snap-container"></div>. This div is where the SNAP application will be placed.
Add snap.embed('${snap-token}', { embedId: ${your div id, for example snap-container} }). This will ensure that SNAP is correctly embedded and rendered within the div you previously set up.

To make the modal blends more seamlessly to your website, is it possible to hide Snap's modal header that shows your merchant/display name. To do so, go to Dashboard > Snap Preference > Theme and Logo > then untick Use Header.


Adjusting Snap Modal Dimension

The default width and height are set to 320px and 560px, which are the minimum sizes that meet our application standards.
Size of snap-container div can be adjusted by adding height and width via CSS. Note that Snap-container size can only be enlarged, but not make it smaller than the default width and height to ensure that customers can easily make payments and ensure all functionality works properly.
We also ensure responsiveness by using flexbox, which sets the width to 100% and follows the flex behavior of its parent. This ensures that the Snap content is appropriately displayed and preserved on smaller devices.



Additional Implementation Notes

Unlike in Pop Up mode; in Embedded mode, X button in the modal is intentionally removed to prevent users from accidentally exiting after making a payment. However, merchant can still close the Snap window by using the hide() method covered in Snap Pop Up guide. Learn more here.
It is not possible to have two different types of Snap instances open simultaneously. If Snap Popup is currently active, Snap Embed cannot be displayed. To switch between the two methods, you will need to hide the active instance using the hide method.
It is possible to hide the header section in Snap modal that shows your merchant/display name. To do so, go to Dashboard > Snap Preference > Theme and Logo > then untick Use Header.

Pop Up Mode

Display the Snap Checkout modal by overlaying it over your page (pop up). Start the payment process by calling window.snap.pay with transaction token.

After following the steps given above, the sample Snap page is displayed as shown below.




Or try the demo here.

After the payment is completed, customer is redirected back to Finish URL. It is specified on Midtrans Dashboard, under menu Settings > Snap Preference > System Settings >Finish URL .



3. Updating Snap Preference

Make sure to update your Snap Preference to customize and prepare your Snap Checkout integration, from your branding, active payment methods, payment expire time to callback URL.




📘
Update Redirection Settings
Make sure to at least update your Redirection Settings (Finish URL, Unfinish URL, Error URL) to make sure your customers will be redirected properly after finishing a payment. If you don't set it up here, you'll need to pass your Finish URLs as part of your Snap token creation requests.



4. Creating Test Payment

Create a test payment to make sure you have integrated Snap successfully. Following are the test credentials for Card payment.


Name	Value
Card Number	4811 1111 1111 1114
CVV	123
Exp Month	Any month in MM format. For example, 02
Exp Year	Any future year, in YYYY format. For example, 2025
OTP/3DS	112233

In addition to that, there are various payment methods available on Snap. You can choose any one of them to create a test payment. For more details, refer to Testing Payments on Sandbox.




5. Handling After Payment

When the transaction status changes, customer is redirected to Redirect URL and Midtrans sends HTTP notification to the merchant backend. This ensures that you are updated of the transaction status securely.

HTTP POST request with JSON body will be sent to your server's Notification URL configured on dashboard.


Configuring Payment Notification URL

To configure the Payment Notification URL, follow the steps given below.

Login to your MAP account.
On the Home page, go to SETTINGS > CONFIGURATION.
Configuration page is displayed.
Enter Payment Notification URL.
Click Update.



The URL is updated and a confirmation message is displayed.

Alternative way to Display Snap Payment Page via Redirect
Alternatively, you can also use redirect_url retrieved from backend in the 1st step to redirect customer to payment page hosted by Midtrans. This is useful if you do not want or can not display payment page on your web page via snap.js.

Additionally, you can configure where customer will be redirected after the payment page, by: Login to your MAP/Midtrans Dashboard account, then go to SETTINGS > CONFIGURATION. Then please configure the Finish, Unfinish, Error Redirection URLs.
